V1.90 BETA 1 
- new MutaGen-module to easily explore new combinations of formulas and settings
   - four types of mutation: 
       - add, remove, exchange formulas
       - modify params of formulas
       - modify Julia-mode
       - modify iteration count    
   - in the UI you may turn on/off those types individually, by specifying a weight, and you may specify an additional strength-parameter
   - you may browse through the already generated generations of mutations and restart on interesting results
   - you may resize the window to alter the size (and render-speed) of the generated thumbnail images
   - you may cancel/restart the mutation-process at any time (sometimes there occur combinations of parameters 
     which may lead to "endless" calculations, in such cases it is helpful to be able to just restart)

- some enhancements of the Formula-window
   - it is resizable now
   - exchanging of formulas now works in two directions
   - Number-Fields have now buttons to decrease/increase the value. The Increment can be specified at the bottom of the window
   - Option to perform automatic refresh of the Navigator-window when changing formulas-parameters in the Formula-window
