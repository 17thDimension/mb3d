V1.90 FINAL BETA

Final changes which will make it into the release:

- Support for animated (height)maps! (Use the new "Map Sequences"-window in the Prefs-section to define them
  and to assign the sequence to a map channel)

- new MutaGen-module to easily explore new combinations of formulas and settings
   - four types of mutations:
       - add, remove, exchange formulas
       - modify params of formulas
       - modify Julia-mode
       - modify iteration count
   - in the UI you may turn on/off those types individually, by specifying a weight, and you may specify an additional
     strength-parameter
   - you may browse through the already generated generations of mutations and restart on interesting results
   - you may resize the window to alter the size of the generated thumbnail images
   - you may cancel/restart the mutation-process at any time (sometimes there occur combinations of parameters
     which may lead to "endless" calculations, in such cases it is helpful to be able to just restart)
   - WARNING: some formula-combinations may crash the program, so save often!
   - This is just the first version, e.g. interpolated functions are not supported yet!
   - Please note that it is intented that this module does not create ready-to-use artworks from scratch.
     It can only happen, when you put in well made parameters (whith everything what makes a great artwork),
     that the mutation will keep many of those properties, making it a nice artwork.
     Or in short: the better your input, the better the output.

- Navigator-size may now be altered (you must expand the right toolbar to see the "Navigator size" control), 
  the last setting is stored to the ini-file

- Global rework of the UI, added theme-support, made "Glossy" the default theme

- Formula-Window:
    - exchanging of formulas now works in two directions

- integrated formula-editor for creating/editing JIT-compiled formulas (see the new buttons in the formula window)
   - support for MB3D's parameters and constants
   - preprocessor to deal with the parameter-handling code
   - backed by the commercial PaxCompiler
   - included support for about 50 mathematical functions
   - watch out for formulas with the prefix "JIT" for examples!

- Many new formulas from the community at fractalforums.com

- New Info-Section at the main window, which now has a button to reach the official bug-reporting tool

################################################################################
V1.90 BETA 10
- flickering when resizing the JIT-formula-window removed
- JIT-editor now supports to enter <tab>-characters

V1.90 BETA 9
- integrated editor for creating/editing JIT-compiled formulas (see the new buttons in the formula window)
- new version for params (*.m3f) with named constants (which are used for JIT-compiled formulas)
- JIT-formula-preprocessor which deals with the nasty param-handling

V1.90 BETA 8
- improved stability when loading maps from within Navigator and Animator in parallel

V1.90 BETA 7
- improved stability when loading maps, especially in the case of missing frames
- new increment-option when defining animated maps (higher values than 1 will skip frames)

V1.90 BETA 6
- improved performance of loading animated maps

V1.90 BETA 5
- improved the refresh behaviour of the Navigator when changing the size
- changed the captions of some buttons in order to make them more readable, especially when using Themes
- new Info-Section at the main window, which now has a button to reach the official bug-reporting tool
- changed the indicator symbols in the post-processing-window

V1.90 BETA 4
- Support for animated (height)maps! (Use the new "Map Sequences"-window in the Prefs-section to define them and to assign the sequence to a map channel)
- Indicators (similar as before) to show active effects in the post-process-windows
- Do not allow to send params from the MutaGen to the main editor while the main editor is rendering
- Some minor UI-related changes

V1.90 BETA 3
- Global rework of the UI, added theme-support, made "Glossy" the default theme
- many internal improvements of the MutaGen
- Navigator-size may now be altered, the last setting is stored to the ini-file
- Simplified the formula-window, removed the Nava-Refresh-option which was introduced with V1.90 BETA 1

V1.90 BETA 2
- MutaGen changes:
   - added an internal probing mode, which generates a collection of mutations at each step and selects the msot "interesting" one, leading to much betters results
   - avoiding certain problematic combinations of formulas (causing program crash or weird looking results)

V1.90 BETA 1 
- new MutaGen-module to easily explore new combinations of formulas and settings
   - four types of mutation:
       - add, remove, exchange formulas
       - modify params of formulas
       - modify Julia-mode
       - modify iteration count
   - in the UI you may turn on/off those types individually, by specifying a weight, and you may specify an additional strength-parameter
   - you may browse through the already generated generations of mutations and restart on interesting results
   - you may resize the window to alter the size (and render-speed) of the generated thumbnail images
   - you may cancel/restart the mutation-process at any time (sometimes there occur combinations of parameters
     which may lead to "endless" calculations, in such cases it is helpful to be able to just restart)

- some enhancements of the Formula-window
   - it is resizable now
   - exchanging of formulas now works in two directions
   - Number-Fields have now buttons to decrease/increase the value. The Increment can be specified at the bottom of the window
   - Option to perform automatic refresh of the Navigator-window when changing formulas-parameters in the Formula-window
